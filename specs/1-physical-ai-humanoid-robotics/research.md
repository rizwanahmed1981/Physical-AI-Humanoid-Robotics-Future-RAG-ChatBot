# Research Findings: Foundations of Physical AI

## Decision: Content Structure Approach

**Decision**: Follow the specified chapter structure exactly as requested:
1. Chapter Overview
2. Section 1: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Intelligence
3. Section 2: What Makes a Robot Intelligent
4. Section 3: Sensors, Actuators, and Physical Constraints
5. Section 4: Humanoid Robots as Physical AI Systems
6. Chapter Summary

**Rationale**: The structure is specifically designed to introduce concepts progressively and align with the learning objectives.

**Alternatives considered**:
- More traditional academic structure
- Different section ordering
- Broader conceptual introduction

The requested structure was chosen because it directly supports the learning outcomes and ensures proper progression from foundational concepts to more complex ideas.

## Decision: Quiz Implementation

**Decision**: Create formative quizzes after each subsection and comprehensive quizzes after each main section.

**Rationale**: This aligns with the constitution requirement for structured assessment as a core feature and supports the pedagogical flow control principle.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Only comprehensive quizzes
- Only formative quizzes
- Different quiz frequency

The specified quiz structure was chosen to ensure learners receive immediate feedback on their understanding while reinforcing key concepts.

## Decision: Conceptual Approach

**Decision**: Focus on conceptual understanding rather than technical implementation details.

**Rationale**: The constitution emphasizes teaching as a calm, experienced mentor guiding a junior engineer. This approach avoids overwhelming beginners with implementation specifics.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Technical deep-dive approach
- Abstract theoretical approach
- Practical hands-on approach

The conceptual approach was selected to align with audience awareness and clarity over cleverness principles.

## Decision: Scope Limitations

**Decision**: Strictly avoid referencing future concepts or tools not yet introduced.

**Rationale**: This directly follows the scope lock requirements to prevent confusion and maintain learning progression.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Brief previews of future topics
- Integration of advanced concepts early
- Forward references to upcoming chapters

The strict scope limitation was chosen to maintain the integrity of the learning progression and avoid cognitive overload.
