# Quickstart Guide: Foundations of Physical AI

This quickstart guide provides an overview of what learners will encounter in Chapter 1: "Foundations of Physical AI".

## Chapter Overview

Chapter 1 introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence. You'll learn how artificial intelligence operates in physical environments through robots and other embodied systems, as opposed to purely digital AI systems.

## Learning Path

1. **Understand Physical AI**: Learn what Physical AI means and why this shift is important
2. **Compare Digital vs Embodied**: Discover the key differences between purely digital AI and AI in physical environments
3. **Explore Intelligent Systems**: Understand how robots perceive, reason, and act in the real world
4. **Examine Physical Constraints**: Learn about sensors, actuators, and how physical limitations affect AI design
5. **Consider Humanoid Applications**: Explore why humanoid robots represent a unique and important category of Physical AI systems

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of AI concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming basics
- No prior robotics experience required

## What You'll Achieve

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Explain the difference between digital AI and embodied intelligence
- Describe how sensors and actuators work in robotic systems
- Understand why physical constraints matter for AI design
- Articulate why Physical AI is important for the future of work and human-robot collaboration

## Quiz Expectations

Each subsection concludes with a formative quiz (5 questions) to test your understanding.
Each main section concludes with a comprehensive quiz (10 questions) covering all subsections.

## Next Steps

After completing Chapter 1, you'll be prepared to move on to Chapter 2: "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" where you'll learn about ROS 2 as the foundation for controlling humanoid robots.
